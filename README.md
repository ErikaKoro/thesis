### Development of Educational Material for Electrical Measurements Laboratory
In todayâ€™s era, with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in research
and industry, the integration of practical IoT applications into academia has become
essential. This integration provides valuable practical skills that are useful both in
the professional field and in fostering creative initiatives. The aim of this study is
to develop educational material for laboratory teaching of Electrical measurements,
while simultaneously incorporating a microcontroller into the experiments, along with
its fundamental operating principles. To develop the material, electrical circuits were
designed to serve the educational purpose of Electrical measurements, measurements
were conducted to verify their accuracy, software was developed to integrate the
microcontroller, and finally, a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was designed to support
the laboratory exercises. However, the flexibility of a microcontroller allows for future
expansions and adaptations of the material to meet new educational and technological
requirements.
